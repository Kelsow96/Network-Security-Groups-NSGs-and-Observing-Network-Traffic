<h1> Observing Network Traffic Between the Two VMs Using Wireshark </h1>

In this tutorial, we'll be using Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) to connect to both of our previously connected VMs (Windows 10 and Linux), installing WireShark onto the Windows 10 VM and filtering certain traffic between both VM's to observe their interactions with one another. 

<h2> Environments and Technologies Used: </h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- WireShark
- PowerShell
- Network Protocols (ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, RDP)

<h2> Operating Systems Used: </h2>

-  Windows 10
-  Linux (Ubuntu)

<h2> List of Prerequisites: </h2>

-  Azure Account/Subscription
-  Previous VMs created in [Part 1](https://github.com/Kelsow96/Creating-VM-s-in-Azure-Windows-10-and-Linux-) of this project

<h2> Steps: </h2>
